# agda-base
This is an experimental base library which is supposed to contain functional datastructures and reflection code.
Equality is out of scope (with the possible exception of things like 'primQNameEquality'). 

# contributions
... are very welcome.

# why?
The idea is to have a common denominator for all the different libraries (e.g. stdlib, cubical, 1lab, ...) and start to work against the tragedy, 
that so much gets implemented again and again, by making the code build on top of basic definitions interchangeable.
